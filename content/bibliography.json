This report takes into account the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) and the IAU Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) definition of dwarf planets, introduces improved values for the pole and rotation rate of Mercury, returns the rotation rate of Jupiter to a previous value, introduces improved values for the rotation of five satellites of Saturn, and adds the equatorial radius of the Sun for comparison. It also adds or updates size and shape information for the Earth, Mars’ satellites Deimos and Phobos, the four Galilean satellites of Jupiter, and 22 satellites of Saturn. Pole, rotation, and size information has been added for the asteroids (21) Lutetia, (511) Davida, and (2867) Šteins. Pole and rotation information has been added for (2) Pallas and (21) Lutetia. Pole and rotation and mean radius information has been added for (1) Ceres. Pole information has been updated for (4) Vesta. The high precision realization for the pole and rotation rate of the Moon is updated. Alternative orientation models for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are noted. The Working Group also reaffirms that once an observable feature at a defined longitude is chosen, a longitude definition origin should not change except under unusual circumstances. It is also noted that alternative coordinate systems may exist for various (e.g. dynamical) purposes, but specific cartographic coordinate system information continues to be recommended for each body. The Working Group elaborates on its purpose, and also announces its plans to occasionally provide limited updates to its recommendations via its website, in order to address community needs for some updates more often than every 3 years. Brief recommendations are also made to the general planetary community regarding the need for controlled products, and improved or consensus rotation models for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,11]]},"author":[{"given":"B.

The Working Group has now become a “functional working group”of the IAU, and its membership is open to anyone interested in participating. We describe the procedure for submitting questions about the recommendations given here or the application of these recommendations for creating a new or updated coordinate system for a given body. Regarding body orientation, the following bodies have been updated: Mercury, based on MESSENGER results; Mars, along with a refined longitude definition; Phobos; Deimos; (1) Ceres; (52) Europa; (243) Ida; (2867) Šteins; Neptune; (134340) Pluto and its satellite Charon; comets 9P/Tempel 1, 19P/Borrelly, 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, and 103P/Hartley 2, noting that such information is valid only between specific epochs. The special challenges related to mapping 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko are also discussed. Approximate expressions for the Earth have been removed in order to avoid confusion, and the low precision series expression for the Moon's orientation has been removed. The previously online only recommended orientation model for (4) Vesta is repeated with an explanation of how it was updated. Regarding body shape, text has been included to explain the expected uses of such information, and the relevance of the cited uncertainty information. The size of the Sun has been updated, and notation added that the size and the ellipsoidal axes for the Earth and Jupiter have been recommended by an IAU Resolution. The distinction of a reference radius for a body (here, the Moon and Titan) is made between cartographic uses, and for orthoprojection and geophysical uses. The recommended radius for Mercury has been updated based on MESSENGER results. The recommended radius for Titan is returned to its previous value. Size information has been updated for 13 other Saturnian satellites and added for Aegaeon. The sizes of Pluto and Charon have been updated. Size information has been updated for (1) Ceres and given for (16) Psyche and (52) Europa. The size of (25143) Itokawa has been corrected. In addition, the discussion of terminology for the poles (hemispheres) of small bodies has been modified and a discussion on cardinal directions added. Although they continue to be used for planets and their satellites, it is assumed that the planetographic and planetocentric coordinate system definitions do not apply to small bodies. However, planetocentric and planetodetic latitudes and longitudes may be used on such bodies, following the right-hand rule. We repeat our previous recommendations that planning and efforts be made to make controlled cartographic products; newly recommend that common formulations should be used for orientation and size; continue to recommend that a community consensus be developed for the orientation models of Jupiter and Saturn; newly recommend that historical summaries of the coordinate systems for given bodies should be developed, and point out that for planets and satellites planetographic systems have generally been historically preferred over planetocentric systems, and that in cases when planetographic coordinates have been widely used in the past, there is no obvious advantage to switching to the use of planetocentric coordinates. The Working Group also requests community input on the question submitting process, posting of updates to the Working Group website, and on whether recommendations should be made regarding exoplanet coordinate systems.","author":[{"given":"B.

We define an open data product as the open result of the processes through which a variety of data (open and not) are turned into accessible information through a service, infrastructure, analytics or a combination of all of them, where each step of development is designed to promote open principles. Open data products are born out of a (data) need and add value beyond simply publishing existing datasets. We argue that the process of adding value should adhere to the principles of open (geographic) data science, ensuring openness, transparency and reproducibility. We also contend that outreach, in the form of active communication and dissemination through dashboards, software and publication are key to engage end-users and ensure societal impact. Open data products have major benefits. First, they enable insights from highly sensitive, controlled and/or secure data which may not be accessible otherwise. Second, they can expand the use of commercial and administrative data for the public good leveraging on their high temporal frequency and geographic granularity. We also contend that there is a compelling need for open data products as we experience the current data revolution. New, emerging data sources are unprecedented in temporal frequency and geographical resolution, but they are large, unstructured, fragmented and often hard to access due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. By transforming raw (open or “closed”) data into ready to use open data products, new dimensions of human geographical processes can be captured and analysed, as we illustrate with existing examples. We conclude by arguing that several parallels exist between the role that open source software played in enabling research on spatial analysis in the 90 s and early 2000s, and the opportunities that open data products offer to unlock the potential of new forms of (geo-)data.","author":[{"given":"Dani","family":"Arribas-Bel"},{"given":"Mark","family":"Green"},{"given":"Francisco","family":"Rowe"},{"given":"Alex","family":"Singleton"}],"DOI":"10.1007/s10109-021-00363-5","type":"article-journal","id":"Arribas:2021","citation-key":"Arribas:2021","ISBN":"1435-5949","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"497-514","title":"Open data products-A framework for creating valuable analysis ready data","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10109-021-00363-5","volume":"23"},{"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]]},"author":[{"given":"Noriaki","family":"Asada"},{"given":"Naru","family":"Hirata"},{"given":"Hirohide","family":"Demura"},{"given":"Naoto","family":"Harada"},{"given":"Yuto","family":"Shibata"},{"given":"Shota","family":"Kikuchi"},{"given":"Tomoki","family":"Hodokuma"},{"given":"Junichi","family":"Haruyama"},{"given":"Makiko","family":"Ohtake"},{"given":"Yasuhiro","family":"Yokota"},{"given":"Tomokatsu","family":"Morota"},{"given":"Chikatoshi","family":"Honda"},{"given":"Tsuneo","family":"Matsunaga"},{"given":"Yoshiko","family":"Ogawa"},{"given":"Masaya","family":"Torii"},{"given":"Tokuhiro","family":"Nimura"},{"given":"Hiroshi","family":"Araki"},{"given":"Seiichi","family":"Tazawa"}],"container-title":"Advances in Geosciences","collection-number":"Volume 19","collection-title":"Advances in Geosciences","DOI":"10.1142/9789812838162_0007","type":"chapter","id":"Asada:2010","citation-key":"Asada:2010","ISBN":"978-981-283-815-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6]]},"page":"77-88","publisher":"World Scientific Publishing Company","title":"Computational geology for lunar data analysis from lism on kaguya","URL":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812838162_0007","volume":"Volume 19"},{"container-title":"Icarus","author":[{"given":"M.K.","family":"Barker"},{"given":"E.","family":"Mazarico"},{"given":"G.A.","family":"Neumann"},{"given":"M.T.","family":"Zuber"},{"given":"J.","family":"Haruyama"},{"given":"D.E.","family":"Smith"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2015.07.039","type":"article-journal","id":"Barker:2016","citation-key":"Barker:2016","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"keyword":"Moon,surface,interior","page":"346 - 355","title":"A new lunar digital elevation model from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter and SELENE Terrain Camera","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515003450","volume":"273"},{"author":[{"given":"K.

Changes in surface color and plume distribution indicate differences in resurfacing processes near hot spots on Io. Patchy emissions were seen while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter. The outer margins of prominent linear markings (triple bands) on Europa are diffuse, suggesting that material has been vented from fractures. Numerous small circular craters indicate localized areas of relatively old surface. Pervasive brittle deformation of an ice layer appears to have formed grooves on Ganymede.

These images provide the only moderate- to high-resolution views of the moon's surface and are therefore a critical resource for scientific analysis and future mission planning. Unfortunately, uncertain knowledge of the spacecraft's position and pointing during image acquisition resulted in significant errors in the location of the images on the surface. The result is that adjacent images are poorly aligned, with some images displaced by more than 100 km from their correct location. These errors severely degrade the usability of the Voyager and Galileo imaging data sets. To improve the usability of these data sets, we used the U.S. Geological Survey Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers to build a nearly global image tie-point network with more than 50,000 tie points and 135,000 image measurements on 481 Galileo and 221 Voyager images. A global least-squares bundle adjustment of our final Europa tie-point network calculated latitude, longitude, and radius values for each point by minimizing residuals globally, and resulted in root mean square (RMS) uncertainties of 246.6 m, 307.0 m, and 70.5 m in latitude, longitude, and radius, respectively. The total RMS uncertainty was 0.32 pixels. This work enables direct use of nearly the entire Galileo and Voyager image data sets for Europa. We are providing the community with updated NASA Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, C-matrix (pointing), and Events kernels, mosaics of Galileo images acquired during each observation sequence, and individual processed and projected level 2 images.","author":[{"given":"Michael T.","family":"Bland"},{"given":"Lynn A.","family":"Weller"},{"given":"Brent A.","family":"Archinal"},{"given":"Ethan","family":"Smith"},{"given":"Benjamin H.","family":"Wheeler"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EA001935","type":"article-journal","id":"Bland:2021","citation-key":"Bland:2021","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"keyword":"Europa,Galileo,Voyager,photogrammetry,control network,mosaic","note":"e2021EA001935 2021EA001935","page":"e2021EA001935","title":"Improving the Usability of Galileo and Voyager Images of Jupiter's Moon Europa","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021EA001935","volume":"8"},{"container-title":"Scientific Data","abstract":"Since the opening of Earth Observation (EO) archives (USGS/NASA Landsat and EC/ESA Sentinels), large collections of EO data are freely available, offering scientists new possibilities to better understand and quantify environmental changes.

THEMIS will map the entire planet in both day and night multi-spectral infrared images at 100-m per pixel resolution, 60% of the planet in one-band visible images at 18-m per pixel, and several percent of the planet in 5-band visible color. Most geologic materials, including carbonates, silicates, sulfates, phosphates, and hydroxides have strong fundamental vibrational absorption bands in the thermal-infrared spectral region that provide diagnostic information on mineral composition. The ability to identify a wide range of minerals allows key aqueous minerals, such as carbonates and hydrothermal silica, to be placed into their proper geologic context. The specific objectives of this investigation are to: (1) determine the mineralogy and petrology of localized deposits associated with hydrothermal or sub-aqueous environments, and to identify future landing sites likely to represent these environments; (2) search for thermal anomalies associated with active sub-surface hydrothermal systems; (3) study small-scale geologic processes and landing site characteristics using morphologic and thermophysical properties; and (4) investigate polar cap processes at all seasons. THEMIS follows the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) experiments, providing substantially higher spatial resolution IR multi-spectral images to complement TES hyperspectral (143-band) global mapping, and regional visible imaging at scales intermediate between the Viking and MOC cameras.","author":[{"given":"Philip R.","family":"Christensen"},{"given":"Bruce M.","family":"Jakosky"},{"given":"Hugh H.","family":"Kieffer"},{"given":"Michael C.","family":"Malin"},{"given":"Harry Y.","family":"McSween"},{"given":"Kenneth","family":"Nealson"},{"given":"Greg L.","family":"Mehall"},{"given":"Steven H.","family":"Silverman"},{"given":"Steven","family":"Ferry"},{"given":"Michael","family":"Caplinger"},{"given":"Michael","family":"Ravine"}],"DOI":"10.1023/B:SPAC.0000021008.16305.94","type":"article-journal","id":"Christensen:2004","citation-key":"Christensen:2004","ISBN":"1572-9672","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"85-130","title":"The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) for the Mars 2001 Odyssey Mission","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/B:SPAC.0000021008.16305.94","volume":"110"},{"container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","abstract":"Laser retroreflectors were placed on the Moon by Apollo 11, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, and Lunakhod 2.

Activity has important implications for the Amazonian history of Mars: understanding processes is a necessary step before we can understand their implications and variations over time.","author":[{"given":"Colin M.","family":"Dundas"},{"given":"Patricio","family":"Becerra"},{"given":"Shane","family":"Byrne"},{"given":"Matthew","family":"Chojnacki"},{"given":"Ingrid J.","family":"Daubar"},{"given":"Serina","family":"Diniega"},{"given":"Candice J.","family":"Hansen"},{"given":"Kenneth E.","family":"Herkenhoff"},{"given":"Margaret E.","family":"Landis"},{"given":"Alfred S.","family":"McEwen"},{"given":"Ganna","family":"Portyankina"},{"given":"Adomas","family":"Valantinas"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JE006876","type":"article-journal","id":"Dundas:2021","citation-key":"Dundas:2021","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"keyword":"Mars,surface changes,seasonal processes,impact cratering,aeolian processes","note":"e2021JE006876 2021JE006876","page":"e2021JE006876","title":"Active Mars: A Dynamic World","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JE006876","volume":"126"},{"container-title":"Remote Sensing","abstract":"Data that have been processed to allow analysis with a minimum of additional user effort are often referred to as Analysis Ready Data (ARD).

In this paper, the availability of the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) ARD over the conterminous United States (CONUS) are quantified for a 36-year period (1 January 1982 to 31 December 2017). Complex patterns of ARD availability occur due to the satellite orbit and sensor geometry, cloud, sensor acquisition and health issues and because of changing relative orientation of the ARD tiles with respect to the Landsat orbit paths. Quantitative per-pixel and summary ARD tile results are reported. Within the CONUS, the average annual number of non-cloudy observations in each 150 × 150 km ARD tile varies from 0.53 to 16.80 (Landsat 4 TM), 11.08 to 22.83 (Landsat 5 TM), 9.73 to 21.72 (Landsat 7 ETM+) and 14.23 to 30.07 (all three sensors). The annual number was most frequently only 2 to 4 Landsat 4 TM observations (36% of the CONUS tiles), increasing to 14 to 16 Landsat 5 TM observations (26% of tiles), 12 to 14 Landsat 7 ETM+ observations (31% of tiles) and 18 to 20 observations (23% of tiles) when considering all three sensors. The most frequently observed ARD tiles were in the arid south-west and in certain mountain rain shadow regions and the least observed tiles were in the north-east, around the Great Lakes and along parts of the north-west coast. The quality of time series algorithm results is expected to be reduced at ARD tiles with low reported availability. The smallest annual number of cloud-free observations for the Landsat 5 TM are over ARD tile h28v04 (northern New York state), for Landsat 7 ETM+ are over tile h25v07 (Ohio and Pennsylvania) and for Landsat 4 TM are over tile h22v08 (northern Indiana). The greatest annual number of cloud-free observations for the Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ ARD are over southern California ARD tile h04v11 and for the Landsat 4 TM are over southern Arizona tile h06v13. The reported results likely overestimate the number of good surface observations because shadows and cirrus clouds were not considered. Implications of the findings for terrestrial monitoring and future ARD research are discussed.","author":[{"given":"Alexey V.","family":"Egorov"},{"given":"David P.","family":"Roy"},{"given":"Hankui K.","family":"Zhang"},{"given":"Zhongbin","family":"Li"},{"given":"Lin","family":"Yan"},{"given":"Haiyan","family":"Huang"}],"DOI":"10.3390/rs11040447","type":"article-journal","id":"Egorov:2019","citation-key":"Egorov:2019","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"Landsat 4, 5 and 7 (1982 to 2017) Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Observation Coverage over the Conterminous United States and Implications for Terrestrial Monitoring","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/4/447","volume":"11"},{"author":[{"given":"E.","family":"Eliason"},{"given":"B.","family":"Castalia"},{"given":"R.","family":"Leis"},{"given":"K.","family":"Becker"}],"type":"report","genre":"techreport","id":"Eliason:2007","citation-key":"Eliason:2007","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"publisher":"NASA JPL","title":"Software Interface Specifiation for HiRISE Experimental Data Record Products","URL":"https://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/DOCUMENT/HIRISE_EDR_SIS.PDF"},{"author":[{"given":"E.","family":"Eliason"},{"given":"B.","family":"Castalia"},{"given":"S.","family":"Mattson"},{"given":"R.","family":"Heyd"},{"given":"K.","family":"Becker"},{"given":"J.","family":"Anderson"},{"given":"S.","family":"Sides"}],"type":"report","genre":"techreport","id":"Eliason:2012","citation-key":"Eliason:2012","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"publisher":"NASA JPL","title":"Software Interface Specifiation for HiRISE Reduced Data Record Products","URL":"https://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/DOCUMENT/HIRISE_RDR_SIS.PDF"},{"author":[{"given":"W.M.","family":"Folkner"},{"given":"J.G.","family":"Williams"},{"given":"D.H.","family":"Boggs"}],"type":"report","genre":"techreport","id":"Folkner:2009","citation-key":"Folkner:2009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"number":"IPN Progress Report 42-178","title":"The Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE 421","URL":"https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-178/178C.pdf"},{"container-title":"Remote Sensing","abstract":"Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an &lsquo;all-in-one&rsquo; solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+.

However, the geodetic position quality of these products is much worse than that of those acquired during the primary mission (at an altitude of 100 km) because of reduced radiometric tracking and frequent thrusting to maintain spacecraft attitude after the loss of momentum wheels. We have analyzed the Kaguya tracking data using gravity models based on the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, and by making use of a new data type based on laser altimeter data collected by Kaguya: we adjust the spacecraft orbit such that the altimetry tracks fit a precise topographic basemap based on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data. This results in geodetically accurate orbits tied to the precise LOLA/LRO frame. Whereas previously archived orbits show errors at the level of several kilometers, the inclusion of altimetry greatly improves the orbit precision, to a level of several tens of meters. When altimetry data are not available, the combination of GRAIL gravity and radio tracking results in an orbit precision of around several hundreds of meters for the low-altitude phase of the extended mission. Our greatly improved orbits result in better geolocation of the Kaguya extended mission data set.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]]},"author":[{"given":"Sander","family":"Goossens"},{"given":"Erwan","family":"Mazarico"},{"given":"Yoshiaki","family":"Ishihara"},{"given":"Brent","family":"Archinal"},{"given":"Lisa","family":"Gaddis"}],"DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113454","type":"article-journal","id":"Goossens:2020","citation-key":"Goossens:2020","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"keyword":"Data reduction techniques,Moon,Orbit determination","language":"en","page":"113454","title":"Improving the geometry of Kaguya extended mission data through refined orbit determination using laser altimetry","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103519304440","volume":"336"},{"author":[{"given":"J.","family":"Haruyama"},{"given":"S.","family":"Hara"},{"given":"K.","family":"Hioki"},{"given":"A.","family":"Iwasaki"},{"given":"T.","family":"Morota"},{"given":"M.","family":"Ohtake"},{"given":"T.","family":"Matsunaga"},{"given":"H.","family":"Araki"},{"given":"K.","family":"Matsumoto"},{"given":"Y.","family":"Ishihara"},{"given":"H.","family":"Noda"},{"given":"S.","family":"Sasaki"},{"given":"S.","family":"Goossens"},{"given":"T.","family":"Iwata"}],"container-title":"43rd Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference","collection-title":"Lunar and Planetary Science Conference","type":"paper-conference","id":"Haruyama:2012","citation-key":"Haruyama:2012","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]},"page":"1200","title":"Lunar Global Digital Terrain Model Dataset Produced from SELENE (Kaguya) Terrain Camera Stereo Observations"},{"container-title":"Advances in Space Research","abstract":"Surface relief maps have a significant role in the investigation of the solid planets.

While specific SRs have been studied in detail over the past few decades, the most recent general survey of these features was conducted in 1969 using Lunar Orbiter IV and V photographs. The current global study updates the catalog of SRs, using higher resolution SELENE and LRO image and topography data to provide detailed observations and measurements of the rilles observed across the lunar surface. The new survey catalogs more than 200 SRs that vary in length from 2km to 566km (median length 33.2km), in width from 160m to 4.3km (median width 480m), in depth from 4.8m to 534m (median depth 49m), in slope from −1.4° to 0.5° (median slope −0.2°), and in sinuosity index from 1.02 to 2.1 (median sinuosity 1.19). Oceanus Procellarum contains 48% of the rilles mapped in this survey, and these rilles are typically associated with the known centers of volcanism within the Procellarum-KREEP Terrain, the Aristarchus Plateau and the Marius Hills. The current study also constrains the timing of the formation of lunar SRs, using the assumptions that the incised unit represents an upper age limit and the terminal or embaying unit represents a lower age limit. Results indicate that the distribution of ages of rille formation is highly correlated with the emplacement ages of mare units, where the majority of rilles are observed to have formed between 3.0Ga and 3.8Ga ago, though some of the features associated with the Aristarchus Plateau may have formed as recently as 1.0Ga to 1.5Ga ago. The documented observations can be used to better understand how SRs formed; for example, the range of slopes observed for all rilles (−1.4° to 0.5°) indicates that thermal erosion is likely dominant during the formation of the 78% of rilles that are observed to have formed in solidified mare basalt material, though mechanical erosion is likely to have been a more significant process during the formation of the 25% of observed rilles that originate in the highlands (20% of the mapped rilles crossed from the highlands into the mare), where a thicker regolith is expected to have been more easily eroded.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]]},"author":[{"given":"Debra M.","family":"Hurwitz"},{"given":"James W.","family":"Head"},{"given":"Harald","family":"Hiesinger"}],"DOI":"10.1016/j.pss.2012.10.019","type":"article-journal","id":"Hurwitz:2013","citation-key":"Hurwitz:2013","ISSN":"0032-0633","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5]]},"keyword":"Lunar rille morphologies,Lunar sinuous rille ages,Lunar sinuous rille formation,Lunar sinuous rilles,Lunar volcanism","language":"en","page":"1-38","title-short":"Lunar sinuous rilles","title":"Lunar sinuous rilles: Distribution, characteristics, and implications for their origin","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063312003303","volume":"79-80"},{"container-title":"GitHub","abstract":"Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers v3.

Mars Express is now in its extended mission phase, during which much of the remaining part of the Martian surface is envisaged to be covered in stereo and color. The HRSC instrument is designed to map the morphology, topography, structure and geologic context of the surface as well as atmospheric phenomena. This paper discusses the measurement principles and operations of the instrument as well as the acquisition, calibration and processing of regional and global data sets. As HRSC is a push-broom scanning instrument with nine CCD line detectors mounted in parallel on a focal plane, its unique feature is the ability to obtain near-simultaneous imaging data at high resolution, with along-track triple stereo, four colors and five different phase angles, avoiding any time-dependent variations of the observing conditions. The HRSC spatial resolution is 10m/pixel at the nominal periapsis altitude of 250km, with an image swath of 53km, and 2.3m/pixel for an additional framing CCD device, called super resolution channel (SRC), practically working as an additional tenth channel of the HRSC and yielding nested-in black and white images for studies of small-scale geologic features. The sub-pixel accuracy of the three-dimensional point determination allows the derivation of digital terrain models (DTMs) with a grid size of up to 50m and a height accuracy of a single pixel with up to 10m, thus enabling us to carry out detailed quantitative analyses of the surface structure. The HRSC (1) bridges the gap between the medium–high-resolution Viking imagery and the very-high-resolution Global Surveyor mission, thus providing geological context, and (2) fills the gaps in the three-dimensional coverage and DTM grid of the MOLA laser altimetry data, and (3) helps characterize landing sites for in-situ measurements. HRSC also builds the basis for extended compositional mapping when combining spectral information with topographic photomaps over large areas. So far the HRSC measurements have made a significant contribution to the study of the evolution of volcanism and the role of water and ice throughout the Martian history.","author":[{"given":"R.","family":"Jaumann"},{"given":"G.","family":"Neukum"},{"given":"T.","family":"Behnke"},{"given":"T.C.","family":"Duxbury"},{"given":"K.","family":"Eichentopf"},{"given":"J.","family":"Flohrer"},{"given":"S.v.","family":"Gasselt"},{"given":"B.","family":"Giese"},{"given":"K.","family":"Gwinner"},{"given":"E.","family":"Hauber"},{"given":"H.","family":"Hoffmann"},{"given":"A.","family":"Hoffmeister"},{"given":"U.","family":"Köhler"},{"given":"K.-D.","family":"Matz"},{"given":"T.B.","family":"McCord"},{"given":"V.","family":"Mertens"},{"given":"J.","family":"Oberst"},{"given":"R.","family":"Pischel"},{"given":"D.","family":"Reiss"},{"given":"E.","family":"Ress"},{"given":"T.","family":"Roatsch"},{"given":"P.","family":"Saiger"},{"given":"F.","family":"Scholten"},{"given":"G.","family":"Schwarz"},{"given":"K.","family":"Stephan"},{"given":"M.","family":"Wählisch"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2006.12.003","type":"article-journal","id":"Jaumann:2007","citation-key":"Jaumann:2007","ISSN":"0032-0633","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"keyword":"Planetary missions,Mars,Mars Express,Imaging instruments,HRSC,Stereo imaging","page":"928-952","title":"The high-resolution stereo camera (HRSC) experiment on Mars Express: Instrument aspects and experiment conduct from interplanetary cruise through the nominal mission","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063306003448","volume":"55"},{"container-title":"Space Science Reviews","abstract":"The Japanese lunar orbiter Kaguya (SELENE) was successfully launched by an H2A rocket on September 14, 2007.

After the apolune altitude was lowered, Kaguya reached its nominal 100 km circular polar observation orbit on October 19. During the process of realizing the nominal orbit, two subsatellites Okina (Rstar) and Ouna (Vstar) were released into elliptical orbits with 2400 km and 800 km apolune, respectively; both elliptical orbits had 100 km perilunes. After the functionality of bus system was verified, four radar antennas and a magnetometer boom were extended, and a plasma imager was deployed. Acquisition of scientific data was carried out for 10 months of nominal mission that began in mid-December 2007. During the 8-month extended mission, magnetic fields and gamma-rays from lower orbits were measured; in addition to this, low-altitude observations were carried out using a Terrain Camera, a Multiband Imager, and an HDTV camera. New data pertaining to an intense magnetic anomaly and GRS data with higher spatial resolution were acquired to study magnetism and the elemental distribution of the Moon.

Where the surface albedo is uniform, the dominant error is 10–20% relative uncertainty in the amplitude of topography and slopes after “calibrating” photoclinometry against a stereo DEM to account for the influence of atmospheric haze. We mapped portions of seven candidate MER sites and the Mars Pathfinder site. Safety of the final four sites (Elysium, Gusev, Isidis, and Meridiani) was assessed by mission engineers by simulating landings on our DEMs of “hazard units” mapped in the sites, with results weighted by the probability of landing on those units; summary slope statistics show that most hazard units are smooth, with only small areas of etched terrain in Gusev crater posing a slope hazard.","author":[{"given":"Randolph L.","family":"Kirk"},{"given":"Elpitha","family":"Howington-Kraus"},{"given":"Bonnie","family":"Redding"},{"given":"Donna","family":"Galuszka"},{"given":"Trent M.","family":"Hare"},{"given":"Brent A.","family":"Archinal"},{"given":"Laurence A.","family":"Soderblom"},{"given":"Janet M.","family":"Barrett"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2003JE002131","type":"article-journal","id":"Kirk:2003","citation-key":"Kirk:2003","issue":"E12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"keyword":"Mars,Mars Exploration Rovers,landing sites,topography,photogrammetry,photoclinometry","title":"High-resolution topomapping of candidate MER landing sites with Mars Orbiter Camera narrow-angle images","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003JE002131","volume":"108"},{"container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","abstract":"The objectives of this paper are twofold: first, to report our estimates of the meter-to-decameter-scale topography and slopes of candidate landing sites for the Phoenix mission, based on analysis of Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images with a typical pixel scale of 3 m and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images at 0.3 m pixel−1 and, second, to document in detail the geometric calibration, software, and procedures on which the photogrammetric analysis of HiRISE data is based. A combination of optical design modeling, laboratory observations, star images, and Mars images form the basis for software in the U.S. Geological Survey Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) 3 system that corrects the images for a variety of distortions with single-pixel or subpixel accuracy. Corrected images are analyzed in the commercial photogrammetric software SOCET SET (® BAE Systems), yielding digital topographic models (DTMs) with a grid spacing of 1 m (3–4 pixels) that require minimal interactive editing. Photoclinometry yields DTMs with single-pixel grid spacing. Slopes from MOC and HiRISE are comparable throughout the latitude zone of interest and compare favorably with those where past missions have landed successfully; only the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) B site in Meridiani Planum is smoother. MOC results at multiple locations have root-mean-square (RMS) bidirectional slopes of 0.8–4.5° at baselines of 3–10 m. HiRISE stereopairs (one per final candidate site and one in the former site) yield 1.8–2.8° slopes at 1-m baseline. Slopes at 1 m from photoclinometry are also in the range 2–3° after correction for image blur. Slopes exceeding the 16° Phoenix safety limit are extremely rare.","author":[{"given":"R.

CTX consists of a digital electronics assembly; a 350 mm f/3.25 Schmidt-type telescope of catadioptric optical design with a 5.7° field of view, providing a ∼30-km-wide swath from ∼290 km altitude; and a 5000-element CCD with a band pass of 500–700 nm and 7 μm pixels, giving ∼6 m/pixel spatial resolution from MRO's nearly circular, nearly polar mapping orbit. Raw data are transferred to the MRO spacecraft flight computer for processing (e.g., data compression) before transmission to Earth. The ground data system and operations are based on 9 years of Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera on-orbit experience. CTX has been allocated 12% of the total MRO data return, or about ≥3 terabits for the nominal mission. This data volume would cover ∼9% of Mars at 6 m/pixel, but overlapping images (for stereo, mosaics, and observation of changes and meteorological events) will reduce this area.

In addition to the near-continuous radiometric tracking data, we include altimetric data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) in the form of crossover measurements, and show that they strongly improve the accuracy of the orbit reconstruction (total position overlap differences decrease from ~70 m to ~23 m). To refine the spacecraft trajectory further, we develop a lunar gravity field by combining the newly acquired LRO data with the historical data. The reprocessing of the spacecraft trajectory with that model shows significantly increased accuracy (~20 m with only the radiometric data, and ~14 m with the addition of the altimetric crossovers).

Images are typically 5–6km wide with 3-color coverage over the central 20% of the swath, and their scales usually range from 25 to 60cm/pixel. Nine hundred and sixty stereo pairs were acquired and more than 50 digital terrain models (DTMs) completed; these data have led to some of the most significant science results. New methods to measure and correct distortions due to pointing jitter facilitate topographic and change-detection studies at sub-meter scales. Recent results address Noachian bedrock stratigraphy, fluvially deposited fans in craters and in or near Valles Marineris, groundwater flow in fractures and porous media, quasi-periodic layering in polar and non-polar deposits, tectonic history of west Candor Chasma, geometry of clay-rich deposits near and within Mawrth Vallis, dynamics of flood lavas in the Cerberus Palus region, evidence for pyroclastic deposits, columnar jointing in lava flows, recent collapse pits, evidence for water in well-preserved impact craters, newly discovered large rayed craters, and glacial and periglacial processes. Of particular interest are ongoing processes such as those driven by the wind, impact cratering, avalanches of dust and/or frost, relatively bright deposits on steep gullied slopes, and the dynamic seasonal processes over polar regions. HiRISE has acquired hundreds of large images of past, present and potential future landing sites and has contributed to scientific and engineering studies of those sites. Warming the focal-plane electronics prior to imaging has mitigated an instrument anomaly that produces bad data under cold operating conditions.","author":[{"given":"Alfred S.","family":"McEwen"},{"given":"Maria E.","family":"Banks"},{"given":"Nicole","family":"Baugh"},{"given":"Kris","family":"Becker"},{"given":"Aaron","family":"Boyd"},{"given":"James W.","family":"Bergstrom"},{"given":"Ross A.","family":"Beyer"},{"given":"Edward","family":"Bortolini"},{"given":"Nathan T.","family":"Bridges"},{"given":"Shane","family":"Byrne"},{"given":"Bradford","family":"Castalia"},{"given":"Frank C.","family":"Chuang"},{"given":"Larry S.","family":"Crumpler"},{"given":"Ingrid","family":"Daubar"},{"given":"Alix K.","family":"Davatzes"},{"given":"Donald G.","family":"Deardorff"},{"given":"Alaina","family":"DeJong"},{"given":"W.","family":"Alan Delamere"},{"given":"Eldar Noe","family":"Dobrea"},{"given":"Colin M.","family":"Dundas"},{"given":"Eric M.","family":"Eliason"},{"given":"Yisrael","family":"Espinoza"},{"given":"Audrie","family":"Fennema"},{"given":"Kathryn E.","family":"Fishbaugh"},{"given":"Terry","family":"Forrester"},{"given":"Paul E.","family":"Geissler"},{"given":"John A.","family":"Grant"},{"given":"Jennifer L.","family":"Griffes"},{"given":"John P.","family":"Grotzinger"},{"given":"Virginia C.","family":"Gulick"},{"given":"Candice J.","family":"Hansen"},{"given":"Kenneth E.","family":"Herkenhoff"},{"given":"Rodney","family":"Heyd"},{"given":"Windy L.","family":"Jaeger"},{"given":"Dean","family":"Jones"},{"given":"Bob","family":"Kanefsky"},{"given":"Laszlo","family":"Keszthelyi"},{"given":"Robert","family":"King"},{"given":"Randolph L.","family":"Kirk"},{"given":"Kelly J.","family":"Kolb"},{"given":"Jeffrey","family":"Lasco"},{"given":"Alexandra","family":"Lefort"},{"given":"Richard","family":"Leis"},{"given":"Kevin W.","family":"Lewis"},{"given":"Sara","family":"Martinez-Alonso"},{"given":"Sarah","family":"Mattson"},{"given":"Guy","family":"McArthur"},{"given":"Michael T.","family":"Mellon"},{"given":"Joannah M.","family":"Metz"},{"given":"Moses P.","family":"Milazzo"},{"given":"Ralph E.","family":"Milliken"},{"given":"Tahirih","family":"Motazedian"},{"given":"Chris H.","family":"Okubo"},{"given":"Albert","family":"Ortiz"},{"given":"Andrea J.","family":"Philippoff"},{"given":"Joseph","family":"Plassmann"},{"given":"Anjani","family":"Polit"},{"given":"Patrick S.","family":"Russell"},{"given":"Christian","family":"Schaller"},{"given":"Mindi L.","family":"Searls"},{"given":"Timothy","family":"Spriggs"},{"given":"Steven W.","family":"Squyres"},{"given":"Steven","family":"Tarr"},{"given":"Nicolas","family":"Thomas"},{"given":"Bradley J.","family":"Thomson"},{"given":"Livio L.","family":"Tornabene"},{"given":"Charlie","family":"Van Houten"},{"given":"Circe","family":"Verba"},{"given":"Catherine M.","family":"Weitz"},{"given":"James J.","family":"Wray"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2009.04.023","type":"article-journal","id":"McEwen:2010","citation-key":"McEwen:2010","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"keyword":"Mars,surface,Mars,climate,Mars,polar geology,Image processing","note":"MRO/HiRISE Studies of Mars","page":"2-37","title":"The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) during MRO's Primary Science Phase (PSP)","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103509001808","volume":"205"},{"author":[{"given":"A.

CRISM's objectives are (1) to map the entire surface using a subset of bands to characterize crustal mineralogy, (2) to map the mineralogy of key areas at high spectral and spatial resolution, and (3) to measure spatial and seasonal variations in the atmosphere. These objectives are addressed using three major types of observations. In multispectral mapping mode, with the OSU pointed at planet nadir, data are collected at a subset of 72 wavelengths covering key mineralogic absorptions and binned to pixel footprints of 100 or 200 m/pixel. Nearly the entire planet can be mapped in this fashion. In targeted mode the OSU is scanned to remove most along-track motion, and a region of interest is mapped at full spatial and spectral resolution (15–19 m/pixel, 362–3920 nm at 6.55 nm/channel). Ten additional abbreviated, spatially binned images are taken before and after the main image, providing an emission phase function (EPF) of the site for atmospheric study and correction of surface spectra for atmospheric effects. In atmospheric mode, only the EPF is acquired. Global grids of the resulting lower data volume observations are taken repeatedly throughout the Martian year to measure seasonal variations in atmospheric properties. Raw, calibrated, and map-projected data are delivered to the community with a spectral library to aid in interpretation.","author":[{"given":"S.","family":"Murchie"},{"given":"R.","family":"Arvidson"},{"given":"P.","family":"Bedini"},{"given":"K.","family":"Beisser"},{"given":"J.-P.","family":"Bibring"},{"given":"J.","family":"Bishop"},{"given":"J.","family":"Boldt"},{"given":"P.","family":"Cavender"},{"given":"T.","family":"Choo"},{"given":"R.

In early northern martian spring, 2008, HiRISE captured several cases of CO2 frost and dust cascading down a steep, polar scarp in discrete clouds. Analysis of morphology and process reveals these events to be similar to terrestrial powder avalanches, sluffs, and falls of loose, dry snow. Potential material sources and initiating mechanisms are discussed in the context of the Martian polar spring environment and of additional, active, aeolian processes observed on the plateau above the scarp. The scarp events are identified as a trigger for mass wasting of bright, fractured layers within the basal unit, and may indirectly influence the retreat rate of steep polar scarps in competing ways.","author":[{"given":"Patrick","family":"Russell"},{"given":"Nicolas","family":"Thomas"},{"given":"Shane","family":"Byrne"},{"given":"Kenneth","family":"Herkenhoff"},{"given":"Kathryn","family":"Fishbaugh"},{"given":"Nathan","family":"Bridges"},{"given":"Chris","family":"Okubo"},{"given":"Moses","family":"Milazzo"},{"given":"Ingrid","family":"Daubar"},{"given":"Candice","family":"Hansen"},{"given":"Alfred","family":"McEwen"}],"DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GL035790","type":"article-journal","id":"Russell:2008","citation-key":"Russell:2008","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"keyword":"seasonal processes,mass wasting HiRISE","title":"Seasonally active frost-dust avalanches on a north polar scarp of Mars captured by HiRISE","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008GL035790","volume":"35"},{"publisher-place":"JHU APL","author":[{"family":"Sato"}],"type":"document","genre":"Presentation","id":"Sato:2021","citation-key":"Sato:2021","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"title":"Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC): Instrument Overview and Data Products","URL":"https://lsic.jhuapl.edu/uploadedDocs/presentations/763-1.07_Sato_TC_20210302_novoice.pdf"},{"container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","abstract":"The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), an instrument on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, has measured the topography, surface roughness, and 1.064-μm reflectivity of Mars and the heights of volatile and dust clouds. This paper discusses the function of the MOLA instrument and the acquisition, processing, and correction of observations to produce global data sets. The altimeter measurements have been converted to both gridded and spherical harmonic models for the topography and shape of Mars that have vertical and radial accuracies of ∼1 m with respect to the planet's center of mass. The current global topographic grid has a resolution of 1/64° in latitude × 1/32° in longitude (1×2 km2 at the equator). Reconstruction of the locations of incident laser pulses on the Martian surface appears to be at the 100-m spatial accuracy level and results in 2 orders of magnitude improvement in the global geodetic grid of Mars. Global maps of optical pulse width indicative of 100-m-scale surface roughness and 1.064-μm reflectivity with an accuracy of 5% have also been obtained.","author":[{"given":"David E.","family":"Smith"},{"given":"Maria T.","family":"Zuber"},{"given":"Herbert V.","family":"Frey"},{"given":"James B.","family":"Garvin"},{"given":"James W.","family":"Head"},{"given":"Duane O.","family":"Muhleman"},{"given":"Gordon H.","family":"Pettengill"},{"given":"Roger J.","family":"Phillips"},{"given":"Sean C.","family":"Solomon"},{"given":"H.

Secondary objectives are to characterize the 1064-nm wavelength surface reflectivity of Mars to contribute to analyses of global surface mineralogy and seasonal albedo changes, to assist in addressing problems in atmospheric circulation, and to provide geodetic control and topographic context for the assessment of possible future Mars landing sites. The principal components of MOLA are a diode-pumped, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser transmitter that emits 1064-nm wavelength laser pulses, a 0.5-m-diameter telescope, a silicon avalanche photodiode detector, and a time interval unit with 10-ns resolution. MOLA will provide measurements of the topography of Mars within approximately 160-m footprints and a center-to-center along-track footprint spacing of 300 m along the Mars Observer subspacecraft ground track. The elevation measurements will be quantized with 1.5 m vertical resolution before correction for orbit- and pointing-induced errors. MOLA profiles will be assembled into a global 0.2° × 0.2° grid that will be referenced to Mars' center of mass with an absolute accuracy of approximately 30 m. Other data products will include a global grid of topographic gradients, corrected individual profiles, and a global 0.2° × 0.2° grid of 1064-nm surface reflectivity.","author":[{"given":"M.
